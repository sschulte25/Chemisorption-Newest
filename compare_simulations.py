The goal is to compare with a given version of the code, either an old one, the previous or current one.
By default, we take the current version of the code (the first time) and compare with the non committed modifications. 
but one can force the change of reference version by using the "rev=xxx" option. Without changing the code, 
one can force the comparison with a different simulation (the one in "example_simulation" will be copied in the other folder)
by using the "force" option.

The script can take various arguments :
(no spaces between the key and the values, only separated by '=')
 * help : display a little help message on HOW to use various options
 * force : To force generation of outputs for the 'old' program (after copying simulation files from the example)
 * actual : To force copying HEAD simulation, compyling it, then generating simulation outputs
 * faq : Display possible problems that might occurs during comparison
 * rev=%s : (previous, actual, current) are possible. Else, every Git ID syntax is OK.
the reference revision for the comparison with actual code

 Example : 
(examples are ordered. From the more common, to the more drastic.)
 compare_simulations.py #only generate new outputs, do nothing for the old one
 compare_simulations.py force # copy inputs in old folder, then generate outputs for both binaries
 compare_simulations.py actual # compile HEAD, copy inputs in old folder, then generate outputs for for both binaries
 compare_simulations.py rev=cdabb998 # compile the given revision, copy input in old folder then generate outputs for both binaries""" % REVISION
